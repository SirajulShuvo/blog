<h1>What is Semantic Element ?</h1>
<p>Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML tags that provide meaning to the content they encapsulate, rather than just how they appear. This approach improves the readability of the code and accessibility of the content, both for developers and for search engines and other technologies like screen readers.</p>
<h1>Benefits of Semantic HTML:</h1>
    Improved Accessibility:
        Screen readers and other assistive technologies can more easily navigate and interpret the content.
        Better SEO:

        Search engines can understand the content and context of web pages more effectively, potentially improving search rankings.
        Enhanced Maintainability:

        Clearer and more meaningful HTML makes it easier for developers to understand and maintain the codebase.
        Consistency:
Using standardized tags ensures a consistent approach across different web projects.

<h1>Common Semantic HTML Tags:</h1>
    "header": Represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids.<br>
    "nav": Represents a section of the page intended for navigation.<br>
    "main": Represents the main content of the body of a document.<br>
    "article": Represents a self-contained composition that could be independently distributed or reused.<br>
    "section": Represents a standalone section of content, typically with a heading.<br>
    "aside": Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main <br>content.
    "footer": Represents the footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.<br>
    "figure": Represents self-contained content, typically with a caption (<figcaption>), and is commonly used to refer to images, diagrams, illustrations, etc.<br>
By using these tags appropriately, you can make your HTML more semantic and your web content more structured and meaningful.
